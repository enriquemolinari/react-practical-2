# Simple CRUD in React

Simple CRUD is a single page application built with React as part of my book [Understanding React](https://leanpub.com/understandingreact). It was built using the [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) components. Implemented using **class based components**. Do you want to see the same application but using function based components? Check [here](http://github.com/enriquemolinari/react-practical-1).

The book is completely **free** for my students (if you want to read it, just write to me).
